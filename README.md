# Bollywood_Social_Network

Social network analysis is a subdiscipline of the social sciences using graph-theoretic concepts
to understand and explain the social structure. It is an approach and set of techniques used to
study the exchange of resources among actors. One such resource is collaboration. Regular
patterns of collaborations reveal themselves as social networks, with actors as nodes in the
network and collaboration relationships as connectors between nodes


This analysis was conducted using the Bollywood Movie Dataset ( https://github.com/calci/bollywood-
movie-dataset ) found on GitHub. The Movie dataset consists of a list of 1285 Bollywood movies
released for the years 2001-2014, as well as the names of the actors that starred in them. It
also contained a list of the top-ranked actors, where they listed the top 300 actors based on an
algorithm of their interest. We considered those actors as our samples to work with.
